# Data_Access_Object_Workshop

## Inspiration
This is my 2nd project done as a part of "Java Developer" course. It is an implementation of DAO pattern. It allowed me to combine knowledge about OOP and MySQL in one programm. 

## How this works
This programm consists of UserDao class. Methods like "read", "update", "create" or "delete" are implemented and allow for modification of users data base.
